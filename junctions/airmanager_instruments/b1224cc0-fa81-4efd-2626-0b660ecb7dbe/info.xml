Transcripted by enjxp_SimPassion to ZIBOmod
I've also designed and re-created all buttons,
dials and switches
---------------------------------------------------
For main background image :
using original background and global panel lights
graphics parts from ZiboMod,
thanks to the kind agreement of the designer

---------------------------------------------------
This panel is a modification of Russ Barlow's MCP for the EADT x737 based on Joe Venzon Boeing 737NG MCP
--------------------------------------------------
This Mode Control Panel (MCP) is only usable with ZiboMod Boeing 737-800X for X-Plane 11. The panel duplicates the function of the 737-800's MCP.
